## Cache Poisoning Checker

### Overview
This Python script checks caching behavior and attempts cache poisoning on a specified URL. It uses the `requests` library to fetch the URL, analyze caching headers, and optionally attempt cache poisoning techniques.

### Features
- **Caching Behavior Analysis:** Analyzes `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, and `Age` headers to determine if the response is being cached.
- **Cache Poisoning Attempt:** Optionally attempts cache poisoning using known techniques if caching is detected.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Accepts a URL as a command-line argument (`--url`) for easy testing.

### Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cache-poisoning-checker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory:**
   ```
   cd cache-poisoning-checker
   ```

3. **Run the script with a URL:**
   ```
   python cachep.py --url https://example.com
   ```
